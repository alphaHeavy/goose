                                        <p>WASHINGTON — The White House is postponing a decision on imposing tariffs on
                                            U.S. imports of steel and aluminum from the European Union, Canada and
                                            Mexico for 30 days, avoiding the potential for a trade battle with Europe as
                                            the U.S. prepares for tense trade talks in China this week.</p>
                                        <p>The Trump administration said Monday it had reached an agreement with South
                                            Korea on steel imports following discussions on a revised trade agreement,
                                            the outlines of which were previously announced by U.S. and South Korean
                                            officials. And the administration said it had also reached agreements in
                                            principle with Argentina, Australia and Brazil on steel and aluminum that
                                            will be finalized shortly.</p>

                                        <p>Announcing the trade actions, the White House said "in all of these
                                            negotiations, the administration is focused on quotas that will restrain
                                            imports, prevent transshipment and protect the national security."</p>
                                        <p>Facing a self-imposed deadline, President Donald Trump was considering
                                            whether to permanently exempt the EU and Mexico, Canada, Australia,
                                            Argentina and Brazil from tariffs that his administration imposed last month
                                            on imported steel and aluminum. The White House provided temporary
                                            exemptions in March and had until the end of Monday to decide whether to
                                            extend them.</p>
                                        <p>The EU has said if it loses its exemption it will retaliate with its own
                                            tariffs on U.S. goods imported to Europe.</p></div>

                                    <div class="body___vDyiy"><p>The confrontation stems from the president's decision
                                        in March to slap tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on
                                        imported aluminum. Trump justified the action by saying it was needed to protect
                                        American metal producers from unfair competition and bolster national security.
                                        But the announcement, which followed an intense internal White House debate,
                                        triggered harsh criticism from Democrats and some Republicans and roiled
                                        financial markets.</p>
                                        <div class="ad-container">
                                            <div></div>
                                        </div>
                                        <p>At the time, Trump excluded several vital trading partners — the European
                                            Union, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Argentina and Brazil — from the
                                            tariffs.</p>
                                        <p>That meant the steel tariff covered just 30 percent of all imports, according
                                            to Oxford Economics. If all the exemptions were ended, it would have
                                            deepened the impact of the tariffs on American companies that use steel and
                                            potentially affect financial markets. Stock prices fell nearly 2 percent
                                            when the tariffs were announced.</p>
                                        <p>Two people familiar with the process said the Trump administration had been
                                            considering whether to provide a short-term extension of the exemptions to
                                            allow for more time to review the countries' efforts to secure permanent
                                            exemptions.</p>
                                        <p>One of the officials said the U.S. trade representative has been overseeing
                                            the process for all of the countries except for the European Union, whose
                                            tariffs are being evaluated by the Commerce Department.</p>
                                        <div class="ad-container">
                                            <div></div>
                                        </div>
                                        <p>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal
                                            deliberations.</p>
                                        <p>The EU and others had been asked to spell out what limits they could accept
                                            on the amount of steel they export to the United States, how they would
                                            address the issue of excess production of steel and aluminum and how they
                                            would support the U.S. before international bodies like the World Trade
                                            Organization. Security relationships with the U.S. have also been part of
                                            the criteria.</p>
                                        <p>South Korea agreed to limit its exports to the United States as part of
                                            broader discussions involved in updating its bilateral trade agreement with
                                            the U.S. and was granted a permanent exemption.</p>
                                        <p>China, Japan and Russia haven't received exemptions from the duties. That
                                            will likely reduce steel shipments from those countries over time. Commerce
                                            Secretary Wilbur Ross said late Friday that quotas on imports from Europe
                                            and other countries are necessary so imports from those countries don't
                                            simply replace Chinese imports. The goal of the tariffs is to reduce total
                                            steel imports and boost U.S. production, Ross said.</p>
                                        <div class="ad-container">
                                            <div></div>
                                        </div>
                                        <p>"If you let everybody back out of the tariff, and you let them out of any
                                            kind of quota, how would you ever reduce the imports here?" Ross asked at a
                                            conference of business journalists. Ross is set to discuss the issue Monday
                                            with EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom.</p>
                                        <p>Germany, the EU's largest steel exporter to the U.S., accounted for about 5
                                            percent of U.S. steel imports last year. South Korea made up the largest
                                            share, shipping about 13 percent of U.S. imports, according to an American
                                            Iron and Steel Institute analysis of government data.</p>
                                        <p>The EU has compiled a list of retaliatory tariffs worth about $3.5 billion it
                                            will impose if its steel and aluminum isn't exempted.</p>
                                        <p>European leaders have resisted the idea of a quota. German Chancellor Angela
                                            Merkel said in a statement Sunday that she discussed the issue with French
                                            President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May after
                                            returning from a White House visit Friday.</p>
                                        <div class="ad-container">
                                            <div></div>

                                        <p>The three European leaders "agreed that the U.S. ought not to take any trade
                                            measures against the European Union," which is "resolved to defend its
                                            interests within the multilateral trade framework," Merkel's statement
                                            said.</p>
                                        <p>In her meeting with Trump, Merkel said, she saw little progress in obtaining
                                            permanent exemptions. "The decision lies with the president," she said
                                            Friday.</p>
                                        <p>A United Kingdom spokesperson called Monday's postponement "positive" and
                                            said, "We will continue to work closely with our EU partners and the U.S.
                                            government to achieve a permanent exemption, ensuring our important steel
                                            and aluminum industries are safeguarded."</p>
                                        <p>In a separate trade battle with China, the United States has threatened to
                                            impose tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods in retaliation for what it
                                            argues are Beijing's unfair trade practices and its requirement that U.S.
                                            companies turn over technology in exchange for access to its market. The
                                            White House also wants China to agree to reduce its $375 billion goods trade
                                            surplus with the U.S.</p>

                                        <p>China has said it would subject $50 billion of U.S. goods to tariffs if the
                                            U.S. taxes its products. Trump has announced that an administration
                                            delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade
                                            Representative Robert Lighthizer and trade adviser Peter Navarro will visit
                                            Beijing for negotiations on Thursday and Friday this week.</p>
                                        <p>In addition to Mnuchin, Lighthizer, Ross and Navarro, the group will include
                                            economic adviser Larry Kudlow, U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad and
                                            Everett Eissenstat, deputy assistant to the president for International
                                            Economic Affairs.</p>
                                        <p>"We're going to have very frank discussions," Mnuchin in an interview
                                            broadcast Monday on Fox Business.</p>
                                        <p>Most analysts, however, think it's unlikely the talks will reach permanent
