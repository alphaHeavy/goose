Most of us are just in it to bulk up our savings for retirement, make a little extra money on the side, or even just beat inflation (more on that in a minute).\nBelow, find 25 investing basics that every 25-year-old should know. Is this everything there is to learn? Of course not. But it\u0027s a solid start.\nAbout the concept\nYour savings account isn\u0027t invested in anything ...&nbsp;You do earn interest on money in savings, but it\u0027s usually less than 1%, and that money sits in the bank.\n... but your retirement savings are.&nbsp;Retirement savings, on the other hand,&nbsp;are&nbsp;invested if you put them in a retirement fund like an IRA or 401(k). This isn\u0027t the case if you simply name your savings account \u0022retirement.\u0022\nInvestments are one of the only ways to keep up with inflation.&nbsp;Inflation lops an&nbsp;average 3.87%&nbsp;off your money\u0027s value every year, so you need your money to grow fast enough to outpace inflation. For most people, investing is the only way to get that kind of growth.\nInvesting is always a risk. Investing could earn you money or lose it. Investments typically aren\u0027t FDIC-insured like a bank account, meaning that there\u0027s the potential to lose money for good.\n\nAbout the jargon\nA security is a financial instrument.&nbsp;You\u0027ll probably hear people refer to \u0022securities,\u0022 which is a catch-all term for things like&nbsp;stocks, bonds, or CDs. Securities are divided into debt securities (money owed to us, like from a government bond), and equity securities (actual value we own, like stocks).\nStocks are equity in a company. When you buy a stock, you\u0027re buying a tiny little piece of an actual company. Not a lot, but ownership nonetheless.&nbsp;Stocks are more volatile than bonds, and may therefore yield greater rewards or losses.\nThe stock market lets you track stock performance.&nbsp;Stocks are traded on \u0022exchanges,\u0022 which make up the overall market. The major stock exchanges in the US include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq. Stock prices are also tracked on indices such as the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. While you\u0027ll want to check in with your individual investments, monitoring stock market activity can give you an idea of how your portfolio might be performing.&nbsp;\nBonds are loans you make. When you purchase a bond, you\u0027re essentially loaning a little money to an entity &mdash;&nbsp;like the US government, for instance &mdash; and that entity has to pay you back after a fixed period of time, with interest. There aren\u0027t bond exchanges that show up in a ticker, because bonds are traded differently than stocks. However, there are sites where you can get an idea of bond pricing, like the&nbsp;Wall Street Journal.\nDiversification means spreading your money out among different kinds of investments. There are a lot of opinions out there about how diversified an investment portfolio needs to be, but most everyone agrees that putting all of your financial eggs in one basket is a recipe for disaster.&nbsp;\nThe ROI is how much money you make on your investments. To get an idea of how well your investments are performing, you can calculate the ROI by dividing an investment\u0027s gains by its costs.\n\nAbout the process\nYou\u0027ll probably be charged fees.&nbsp;Investing isn\u0027t free. If you\u0027re working with an investment professional, you\u0027ll pay them either a percentage of your portfolio or a flat fee (you\u0027ll want to know if your advisor is&nbsp;\u0022fee-based\u0022 or \u0022fee-only\u0022&nbsp;before you sign on), online investment platforms or \u0022robo-advisors\u0022 each have their own fee structures, and some&nbsp;mutual funds and ETFs also charge fees. These fees vary, and if you do your research, you can minimize them.&nbsp;\nYou don\u0027t have to pick stock by stock.&nbsp;Professionals collect groups of securities called&nbsp;mutual funds, and you can invest in these funds to diversify your money without picking every individual stock or bond yourself.&nbsp;Index funds&nbsp;are mutual funds chosen to reflect a specific stock index, such as the S&amp;P 500.\nYou may have to pay taxes due to your investments ...&nbsp;The US government doesn\u0027t let you have the money you may make investing for free. When you cash in, you\u0027ll owe what\u0027s called&nbsp;capital gains taxes.\n... but you also may receive a tax break.&nbsp;Although different retirement accounts have different tax structures, contributions are often tax-deductible.&nbsp;529 savings plans, which are also investment accounts, are similarly tax-advantaged.\nSometimes, you\u0027ll fail.&nbsp;It\u0027s an unfortunate truth that we won\u0027t all be rock star investors. For some people to do really well,&nbsp;others must do poorly. And sometimes, you\u0027re the \u0022other.\u0022\n\nAbout strategy\nStarting early is a major advantage. In your 20s, your biggest asset is time. Even when you\u0027re just investing in retirement savings, nothing can make up for the effect of compound interest. Also, if you lose money in the market, you\u0027ll have more time to make it back before you need it.\nHot stocks probably aren\u0027t your ticket. There\u0027s always a stock to buzz about, but that doesn\u0027t guarantee it will be your ticket to wealth. It\u0027s a better bet to research the company and make your own decision than to blindly jump on the stock of the moment.\nYour long-term strategy has nothing to do with that morning\u0027s news.&nbsp;Most investors shouldn\u0027t \u0022buy\u0022 or \u0022sell\u0022 every time it\u0027s recommended on TV. There\u0027s an entire documentary explaining why active investing &mdash; buying and selling stocks strategically and often &mdash; doesn\u0027t work for most people.\nGetting too attached to individual stocks can be dangerous. If you own a particular security you\u0027re attached to for sentimental reasons or because of its past performance, you might be reluctant to ditch it even if your advisor or investment professional says to. Securities are&nbsp;only as good as how they\u0027re performing currently, and you have to be willing to let low performers go.&nbsp;\nYou don\u0027t need to check constantly. If you\u0027ve caught sight of a stock ticker (on Business Insider, for example), you\u0027re probably aware that markets go up and down&nbsp;every day, and so do individual stocks. If you\u0027re investing for the long term and aren\u0027t an investing professional, you don\u0027t need the anxiety of a running ticker on your desktop.\nDon\u0027t invest money you\u0027ll need soon. If you\u0027ll need quick access to liquid cash in the short term, you won\u0027t want to park that money in the stock market. Some professionals say you shouldn\u0027t invest money you\u0027ll need in the next five years, because if the market goes down, you won\u0027t have enough time to recoup those funds.\n\nAbout keeping a cool head\nNo one can reliably predict the market. They just can\u0027t. While professionals can make educated guesses, predicting the market is predicting the future, and no one can do it.\nAnd past market behavior isn\u0027t a reliable way to predict the future. On that same note, looking at what the markets have done isn\u0027t a reliable way to predict what they will do. Again, this is a case of predicting the future, which could go in an unexpected direction due to unforeseen events known as \u0022black swans.\u0022\nYou don\u0027t know what you don\u0027t know. There\u0027s a lot to learn about the stock market, and it\u0027s a big mistake to think that you\u0027re an expert just because you\u0027re a generally smart, capable person. There\u0027s always more to learn.&nbsp;\nYou don\u0027t have to do it yourself. You don\u0027t have to be an expert to invest. There are&nbsp;financial planners, wealth advisors, and even automated online investing platforms (robo-advisors) to guide you.\nThis post has been updated to clarify that the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are indices, not exchanges.","articleSection":"Your Money, Finance, Wealth Advisor, Strategy"}

There are&nbsp;financial planners, wealth advisors, and even automated online investing platforms (robo-advisors) to guide you.\nThis post has been updated to clarify that the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are indices, not exchanges.","articleSection":"Your Money, Finance, Wealth Advisor, Strategy"}

You're never too young to invest. </p><p> Yes, investing can seem intimidating, and yes, there are experts out there who seem to speak a whole different language, but not everyone needs to make a career out of it. Most of us are just in it to bulk up our savings for retirement, make a little extra money on the side, or even just beat inflation (more on that in a minute). </p><p> Below, find 25 investing basics that every 25-year-old should know. Is this everything there is to learn? Of course not. But it's a solid start. </p><h3> About the concept </h3><p><strong>Your savings account isn't invested in anything ...</strong> You do earn interest on money in savings, but it's usually less than 1%, and that money sits in the bank. </p><p><strong>... but your retirement savings are.</strong> Retirement savings, on the other hand, <em>are</em> invested if you put them in a retirement fund like an IRA or 401(k). This isn't the case if you simply name your savings account "retirement." </p><div data-bi-ad id="ad-32330"

The major stock exchanges in the US include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq. Stock prices are also tracked on indices such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. While you'll want to check in with your individual investments, monitoring stock market activity can give you an idea of how your portfolio might be performing. </p><p><strong>Bonds are loans you make.</strong> When you purchase a bond, you're essentially loaning a little money to an entity &mdash; like the US government, for instance &mdash; and that entity has to pay you back after a fixed period of time, with interest. There aren't bond exchanges that show up in a ticker, because bonds are traded differently than stocks. However, there are sites where you can get an idea of bond pricing, like the <a href=http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3022-bondbnchmrk.html target=_blank>Wall Street Journal</a>. </p><p><strong>Diversification means spreading your money out among different kinds of investments.</strong> There are a lot of opinions out there about <a href=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-people-get-wrong-on-diversification-2014-2 target=_blank>how diversified an investment portfolio needs to be</a>, but most everyone agrees that putting all of your financial eggs in one basket is a recipe for disaster. </p><p><strong>The ROI is how much money you make on your investments.</strong> To get an idea of how well your investments are performing, you can <a href=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp target=_blank>calculate the ROI</a> by dividing an investment's gains by its costs. </p><p><figure id="img-253013" class="figure image-figure-image  postload" data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" style=""><postload-img data-src="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5391d06a69bedd7d2903e629-750-375.jpg" data-sizes="(min-width: 960px) and (max-width: 1259px) 640px, (min-width: 1260px) 960px, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) 50vw, 100vw" data-srcset="https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5391d06a69bedd7d2903e629-160-80.jpg 160w, https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5391d06a69bedd7d2903e629-320-160.jpg 320w, https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5391d06a69bedd7d2903e629-480-240.jpg 480w, https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5391d06a69bedd7d2903e629-640-320.jpg 640w, https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5391d06a69bedd7d2903e629-750-375.jpg 750w, https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5391d06a69bedd7d2903e629-960-480.jpg 960w, https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5391d06a69bedd7d2903e629-1136-568.jpg 1136w" data-alt="front nyse" ></postload-img><span class="image-source-caption"><figcaption class="image-caption" data-e2e-name="image-caption">The New York Stock Exchange is a major fixture of Wall Street.</figcaption><span class="image-source" data-e2e-name="image-source">

It's a better bet to research the company and <a href=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-i-just-bought-1000-of-twitter-stock-2014-5 target=_blank>make your own decision</a> than to blindly jump on the stock of the moment. </p><p><strong>Your long-term strategy has nothing to do with that morning's news.</strong> Most investors shouldn't "buy" or "sell" every time it's recommended on TV. There's an <a href=http://www.businessinsider.com/mastering-passive-investing-movie-2013-3 > entire documentary</a> explaining why active investing &mdash; buying and selling stocks strategically and often &mdash; doesn't work for most people. </p><p><strong>Getting too attached to individual stocks can be dangerous.</strong> If you own a particular security you're attached to for sentimental reasons or because of its past performance, you might be reluctant to ditch it even if your advisor or investment professional says to. Securities are <a href=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-you-wont-ditch-underperforming-stock-2014-7 target=_blank>only as good as how they're performing currently</a>, and you have to be willing to let low performers go. </p><p><strong>You don't need to check constantly.</strong> If you've caught sight of a stock ticker (on <a href=http://www.businessinsider.com/ >Business Insider</a>, for example), you're probably aware that <a href=http://www.businessinsider.com/mastering-passive-investing-movie-2013-3 > markets go up and down</a> every day, and so do individual stocks. If you're investing for the long term and aren't an investing professional, you don't need the anxiety of a running ticker on your desktop. </p><p><strong>Don't invest money you'll need soon.</strong> If you'll need quick access to liquid cash in the short term, you won't want to park that money in the stock market.
